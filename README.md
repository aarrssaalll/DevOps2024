# DevOps with Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  

## Overview  

Welcome to my DevOps project! This repository demonstrates my expertise in managing cloud infrastructure through **Terraform**, enabling Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for scalability, automation, and efficiency. With Terraform, I have provisioned and managed resources across multiple cloud providers, ensuring consistent and reliable environments for development and production.  

This project showcases practical Terraform use cases, including modular resource configurations, automated deployments, and best practices for version control. Additionally, **GitHub Actions** is used to streamline the continuous integration and deployment of infrastructure changes.  

> **Key Technologies Used:**  
> - **Terraform**: For defining and provisioning cloud infrastructure as code.  
> - **AWS/GCP/Azure**: As the cloud platform for resource management.  
> - **GitHub Actions**: To automate CI/CD workflows for infrastructure provisioning.

## Project Highlights  

### 1. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**  
   - Designed reusable and modular Terraform configurations for provisioning compute, storage, and networking resources.  
   - Managed state remotely for collaboration and consistency across teams.  
   - Used variables and outputs to enable scalable and flexible infrastructure setups.  

### 2. **CI/CD for Terraform**  
   Integrated **GitHub Actions** to automate the validation and deployment of Terraform configurations. Key pipeline features include:  
   - Validating Terraform configurations with `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`.  
   - Automatically applying changes to the infrastructure upon merging to the main branch.  
   - Managing sensitive data using encrypted secrets for Terraform providers.  

### 3. **Multi-Environment Support**  
   Implemented a directory structure and workflow for managing multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, and production).  
   - Used workspaces to separate environment states.  
   - Defined environment-specific variables to ensure seamless resource management.  

### 4. **Cloud Resource Provisioning**  
   Provisioned the following resources based on project requirements:  
   - **Compute**: Virtual machines, auto-scaling groups, or Kubernetes clusters.  
   - **Storage**: S3 buckets, Azure Blob Storage, or GCP Cloud Storage.  
   - **Networking**: VPCs, subnets, and load balancers for secure and efficient communication.

## Learning and Insights  

This project provided hands-on experience in:  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Building and managing cloud resources with declarative configurations.  
- **Terraform Modules**: Creating reusable modules to standardize and simplify infrastructure deployments.  
- **CI/CD for IaC**: Automating the infrastructure lifecycle with pipelines.  
- **State Management**: Using remote backends to ensure consistent and secure state management.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Terraform installed on your local machine ([Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)).  
- A configured cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).  
- Access to a remote state backend (e.g., AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, or Azure Storage).  

### Steps to Run the Project  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-project.git  
   cd terraform-project
   ```
Initialize Terraform:

```
terraform init
```
Preview Changes:
Generate an execution plan to preview infrastructure changes:

```
terraform plan  
```
Apply Changes:
Provision the defined infrastructure:

```
terraform apply  
```
Verify Resources:
Access the cloud provider's console or CLI to verify that resources were provisioned as expected.

Destroy Infrastructure:
To tear down the infrastructure:

```
terraform destroy
```
